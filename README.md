# 2-3-Trees
Basic 2-3 Tree Data Structure.

This code can work for all B-Trees if you change lines 88-89 to a for loop.
In the for loop, make all the keys in left all they keys up to the middle key of the current node.
Make all the keys in right all the keys after the middle key fo the current node.

After this, the code can work for any B-Tree, just change key and children array sizes.
